        <h3>This iteration of the model is designed primarily for practicing Blender, and was built off of the 1st generation,
            <br/>with some general improvements being made to the mesh. <br/>This one has been designed with Blender in mind, with
            an adjustable mouth, eyes, <br/>and swappable face textures that can all be changed within Blender.

                <p>The best way to get in touch with me initially is via Twitter/X if we haven't spoken before, it's where 
                    I'm most active. Though it seems I don't actually get pings for message requests, which is really annoying.
                    It's not that I'm ignoring you deliberately, it's just that Elon is doing my DMs dirty.
                    <br/>Typically after we've gotten the ball rolling, I'll give you my Discord handle and we can go from there :)

                <p>I use PayPal for commissions, I don't have any other alternatives and don't plan on using any either.
                    <br />
                    Payments for modelling is not up-front, once I get a good looking model created, I will then ask for payment.

                <p>Blender! I use the Steam version, which at the time of writing (January 2024) is Blender 4.0

                <p>Of course! Using visual references for a commission, be it a picture of a pose, or a stickman drawing, or whatever,
                    really helps out as it gives me a clearer idea of what you want. 
                    Just don't send me NSFW material, I'm not interested in seeing it.

                </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                <p>If I've made some dumb error and it needs fixing (i.e missing bit of shading, or it's not blended), 
                    I'll fix that just fine :)
                    <br/>Regarding pretty big adjustments, for example if you want the pose changed, then
                    I'll need to know BEFORE I start outlining onwards.
                    <br/>I'll send you the sketch when it's done and then wait for your approval to go ahead with outlining, 
                    after this point I'm going to assume it's all good and won't be changed.
